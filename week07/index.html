                    <li>
                        An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the
                        program to deal with the error.

                    <li>
                        A stack trace will work
                        backwards from the point at which the error occurred to identify the original
                        function or method that started the sequence.

                    <li>
                        The stacks trace to work backwards and see that this error was caused by invoking the
                        function one() in the first place.

                Warnings

                    <li>
                        A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn’t enough to cause the
                        program to crash. This means the program will continue to run after a warning.
                        This might sound good, but it can be problematic.

                The Importance of Testing and Debugging
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        JavaScript implements exceptions at all until ECMAScript version 3.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The stacks trace to work backwards and see that this error was caused by invoking the function one() in the first place.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A programmer should try to make the code fail gracefully.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Strict Mode
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        ECMAScript 5 introduced a strict mode that produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Strict mode encourages a better quality of JavaScript to be written that befits a ninja programmer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Strict mode simply requires the following string to be added to the first line of a JavaScript file:
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        'use strict';

                Linting Tools

                    <li>
                        Linting tools are also useful for enforcing a programming style guide.

                Feature Detection
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The recommended way to determine browser support for a feature is to use
                        feature detection. This is done using an if statement to check whether an
                        object or method exists before trying to actually call the method.

                        sniffing. This involves using the string returned by window.navigator.userAgent
                        property
                    </li>
                </ul>

                Debugging in the Browser
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then
                        dealing with them.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <li>
                The Trusty Alert
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The most basic form of debugging is to use the alert() method to show a dialog
                        at certain points in the code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
					alert() stops a program from running until
                    OK is clicked, it allows us to effectively put breakpoints in the code that let us
                    check the value of variables at that point to see if they’re what we expect them to
                    be.

                </ul>

                Using the Console
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Most modern JavaScript environments have a console object that provides a
                        360 JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition
                        number of methods for logging information and debugging.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The console.log() method can be used to
                        log the value of variables at different stages of the program
                    </li>
                </ul>

                Debugging Tools
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Most modern browsers also have a debugging tool that allows you to set
                        breakpoints in your code that will pause it at certain points.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        One of the most useful commands is the debugger keyword.

                        EvalError is not used in the current ECMAScript specification and only
                        retained for backwards compatibility. It was used to identify errors when
                        using the global eval() function.

                    <li>
                        ReferenceError is thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn’t
                        exist. For example, calling a function that hasn’t been defined.
                    </li>

                        SyntaxError is thrown when there’s an error in the code’s syntax.

                    <li>
                        TypeError is thrown when there’s an error in the type of value used; for
                        example, a string is used when a number is expected.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        URIError is thrown when there’s a problem encoding or decoding the URI.

                    <li>
                        InternalError is a non-standard error that is thrown when an error occurs in

                    <li>
                        The name property returns the name of the error constructor function used as a

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The message property returns a description of the error and should be
                        provided as an argument to the Error constructor function.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The stack property will return a stack trace for that error.

                                To throw an error object. This can then be caught in a

                                When an exception occurs, the program terminates with an error message.

                                The code inside the catch block will only run if an exception is thrown inside
                                the try block. The error object is automatically passed as a parameter to the
