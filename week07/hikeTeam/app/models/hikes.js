    // why is this function necessary?  hikeList is not exported, and so it cannot be seen outside of this module. I added this in case I ever need the list of hikes outside of the module. This also sets me up nicely if my data were to move. I can just change this method to the new source and everything will still work if I only access the data through this getter.
