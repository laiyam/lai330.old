To Do list:
1. The two first methods to complete should be the initPos method from the controller, then the getEarthQuakesByRadius method from the model, test each method as you finish them.
  
  - Rui16002: The model seems to be completed although I haven't tested it yet. I get an error on initPos due two a Plunker limitation it seems, the promise gets rejected. See console.
    We may have to work on this on a local server and then upload the results.

2. After that work on the rest of the controller or View methods as it makes sense. I would recommend following the same order...finish a method, then test. It will keep your errors under control and make your code easier to troubleshoot.

  - Rui16002: renderQuakeList and renderQuake need to be completed, information about how to do so is available as comments.

3. Styles: Once we have it working, we can make it pretty.
